## Project Overview

The **Online Course Analysis** project focuses on analyzing recorded lecture data collected from multiple EdTech platforms. The purpose of this analysis is to help an EdTech startup better understand learner behavior, identify high-demand course categories, and optimize its recorded lecture offerings.

The Power BI dashboard delivers **category-wise insights** covering course distribution, learner engagement, skill relevance, language preferences, instructor performance, and accessibility features such as subtitles.

* Improve course planning and launch strategies
* Enhance accessibility for diverse learner groups
* Align course content with learner preferences and current job market demand

The **primary focus of this analysis is category-wise performance and trends**.
